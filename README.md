## Description

This project involved creating a scrolling Story Map that would serve as an introduction and complement to a Dashboard Tool for showing the development risk of Vacant Lots across Philadelphia, as part of the Smart Cities Practicum (MUSA801) in Weitzman School of Design.

The intention of the story map is to guide a user that is not familiar with the story of vacant lots and delinquencies in Philadelphia by summarizin this complex issue, into a simple step by-step walkthrough along the different actors and topics surrounding this issue, while looking at different scales in time and space.

## Data

The project used data from Open Data Philly, including, properties, vacant lots, real estate delinquencies, real estate transfers, L&I Zoning Permits. It also implements data from the 2019 American Community Survey to determine the divide between majority-white and majority-minority neighborhoods, as well as the divide in above and below median income households. This data was preprocessed and condensed for the purposes of the Smart Cities Practicum project and exported into several files to be read by this application.
