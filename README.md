# What's in a Vacant Lot?
* Data Dashboard and Development Risk Assessment for Vacant Lots in Philadelphia
* A project from the Weitzman School of Design Smart Cities Practicum in collaboration with Philadelphia Legal Assistance

In recent years, the City of Philadelphia has been foreclosing on tax delinquent vacant properties in bulk. Many of these properties represent cherished community assets includingÂ public parks, urban gardens, and side yards. Often, neighbors who have tended to these properties for years never find out that they are up for sale until they have already been bought. A variety of grassroots and legal advocacy organizations have taken up the mantle to explore these options, and more, to ensure that vacant lots remain in the care of the neighbors and communities who have invested in them for years. 

In collaboration with Philadelphia Legal Assistance (PLA), we are creating a data dashboard and storymap
1. to visualize and explore the vacant lots in Philadelphia; 
2. to assist PLA in weighing viable legal and policy interventions;
3. to predict which properties are at greatest risk of disposition and development.

## Scrolling Story Map

This project involved creating a scrolling Story Map that would serve as an introduction and complement to a Dashboard Tool for showing the development risk of Vacant Lots across Philadelphia, as part of the Smart Cities Practicum (MUSA801) in Weitzman School of Design.

The intention of the story map is to guide a user that is not familiar with the story of vacant lots and delinquencies in Philadelphia by summarizin this complex issue, into a simple step by-step walkthrough along the different actors and topics surrounding this issue, while looking at different scales in time and space.

## Data

The project used data from Open Data Philly, including, properties, vacant lots, real estate delinquencies, real estate transfers, L&I Zoning Permits. It also implements data from the 2019 American Community Survey to determine the divide between majority-white and majority-minority neighborhoods, as well as the divide in above and below median income households. This data was preprocessed and condensed for the purposes of the Smart Cities Practicum project and exported into several files to be read by this application.
